      <p class="large-text">The studio has, against all odds, finished three projects so far. They have designed and built websites for a band named <a href="dauphines/index.html"><span class="name">Dauphine's Revival</span></a>, a gallery called <span class="name">The Velvet Velvet</span>, and a restaurant called <span class="name">Pines of Nowhere</span>. All in all not bad for the group.</p>

      <h2>Link #8</h2>
      <p>Link the words Daupine's Revival in the above text to the page in the dauphines folder. Also give each span element a class of name.</p>
